## Features

- **Race Winner Prediction**: Binary classification to predict which driver will win
- **Position Prediction**: Predict finishing positions (1-20) for all drivers
- Multiple ML algorithms: K-NN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ANN, CatBoost Ranker

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-ml-predictions.git
cd f1-ml-predictions

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow catboost imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data

This project uses F1 data from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020

The raw F1 data undergoes several processing steps:
1. Merging Datasources: Combines 5 separate datasets (results, races, drivers, constructors, standings) into one complete dataset.
2. Feature Engineering: After extensive experimentation, including testing weather data and other variables, three key features emerged as the most impactful for prediction accuracy:
  - previousDriverPoints: Championship points accumulated by the driver before the current race

    Captures current season performance and momentum
    Reset to 0 at the start of each season
    Uses shift(1) to prevent data leakage

  - previousConstructorPoints: Championship points accumulated by the team before the current race

    Reflects car performance and team competitiveness throughout the season
    Accounts for technical development and reliability

  - avgOvertakes: Average positions gained/lost at specific circuits from previous years

    Calculated as: startGridPosition - finishingPosition
    Circuit-specific metric showing driver's historical performance at each track
    Only uses data from previous races at that circuit
    Captures driver skill on different track layouts (street circuits vs. high-speed tracks)

Note on Weather Data: Meteorological features were tested but showed minimal impact on prediction accuracy. The three features above proved most relevant for model performance.

3. Data Cleaning

Removes incomplete records
Sorts chronologically by year and round
Renames columns for clarity
Drops intermediate calculation columns

4. Target Variables

finishingPosition: Race finish position (1-20) for position prediction
winner: Binary flag (1/0) for winner prediction

Key principle: All features use only information available before the race to prevent data leakage.
Models
Winner Prediction

Binary classification (win/not win)
Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ANN

Position Prediction

Multi-class classification or regression
Models: K-NN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ANN, CatBoost Ranker
Evaluation: Exact accuracy, MAE, Within ±N positions

Training data: 1950-2018  
Test data: 2019-2024
